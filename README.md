# BlueDrop


## Project Overview
This project aims to calculate the water footprint of common daily household items and provide users with information to make more sustainable choices by opting for items with a lower water footprint. **_Water footprint_** refers to the amount of water used to produce or manufacture a particular product. By raising awareness about water consumption in our everyday lives, we can contribute to water conservation efforts.

The BlueDrop is a mobile application designed to help users calculate the water footprint of everyday household items. Users can either search for items manually or scan product images to retrieve water footprint information. This app aims to raise awareness about water consumption and promote more sustainable choices in daily life.
